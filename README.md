# OCULAR PROGNOSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING
Diabetes Mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder, poses a significant global health challenge. Early detection and proactive management of diabetes can significantly mitigate its impact on individuals. This project introduces Eye Lens, a novel predictive model that leverages ocular features extracted from retinal images for early diabetic prediction. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, Eye Lens aims to offer an accessible and non-invasive solution to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. This system explores the application of machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Residual Networks (ResNet), in predicting ocular prognosis. We ensure to give an accuracy at least the range of 98%. By analyzing a vast dataset of ocular images, these algorithms aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and forecast the progression of eye conditions. Establish a user-friendly interface for healthcare practitioners, facilitating seamless integration of the machine learning system into existing diagnostic workflows. Thissystem delves into how CNN and ResNet models effectively recognize patterns and features within images, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of ocular health. The Results show promising advancements in prognosis precision, paving the way for improved patient care and early intervention strategies. This signifies a 
noteworthy step towards leveraging machine learning for ocular health assessment.
