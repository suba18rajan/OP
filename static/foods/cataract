Almost everyone knows how good carrots are for the eyes. There are beta-carotenes in it, lutein and zeaxanthin, which the body converts into vitamin A. Carrots are good for your overall eye health and help keep eye problems at a minimum.

2. Fruits and vegetables
Yellow, red and orange pigments are produced by carotenoids in colourful fruits and vegetables. Usually, these foods are eaten raw, but for the best health benefits, they should be boiled or baked first. Cantaloupes, sweet potatoes, carrots and pumpkins contain carotenoids such as beta carotene and vitamin A, which are good for your eyes.

3. Fish
Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish can reduce one’s risk of cataracts because they have been linked with lowering one’s risk of eye disease. You should consume two servings of cold-water fish every week, such as tuna, salmon and sardines. You can take fish oil supplements if you are not a fan of fish.
